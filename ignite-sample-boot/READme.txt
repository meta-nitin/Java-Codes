This is a spring boot web application where apache ignite cache is used. Here I have constructed a ignite server and connected to it in the same project. Generally the client apps connect to the server via property (<property name="clientMode" value="true"/>) under bean "org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration". We can then write/read data from/to the cache using client application.
